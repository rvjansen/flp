\chapter{Colofon}The large gap between inception and execution of this
project was probably a good thing, certainly from a technical
perspective, because only in recent years large address spaces and
multi-engine 64 bit CPU's became available; this enabled the use of a
large Prolog address space to do all the data storage and reasoning
in. Apart from Prolog (SWI Prolog and JPL for the JVM interface)
NetRexx is the main programming language used. The book itself is set
in \XeLaTex, from text sources produced by NetRexx and Prolog.
