This is, in short, the book that I would have wished for 25 years ago,
when I met my wife-to-be. I am the type of person that rather spends a
number of days reading the instructions before opening the package,
and I have read numerous books about languages that I never
encountered or programmed in. I have learned to speak the language
through the natural method of being exposed to it every day at home;
although my wife speaks Dutch very well, she would rather not. I wished there were good books around then when I first learned the language - but the dictionaries were mostly lists of words, none of the official orthography documents existed, and the course material was hopelessly dated. I hope, with this book, to have contributed what I can, and to return to the community what it has given me over the years. I have attributed where possible, and am not claiming anything as my own invention. For this reason, the book has a creative commons-share alike license.

In the hope there is something useful for everyone in this, this book is dedicated to my sweet and beautiful wife, Venetia Jansen-Maduro, and the sweet and beautiful language she speaks.
